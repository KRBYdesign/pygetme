# (py)GetMe

(py)GetMe is a small python script that will print system information to the console. Similar to neofetch but without the excitement of your OS' logo. Built and tested on MacOS Sequoia 15.1.

**NOTE: This (probably) does not work on your linux box. I may extend the script to be compatible with some flavors in the future though. This most definitely does not work on your Windows box. Nor will it. I have no intentions of porting this to be Windows compatible**

This was written to fit my specific needs and may not have the functionality you require. Fork it and move on please.
